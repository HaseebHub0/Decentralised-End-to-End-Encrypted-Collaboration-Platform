# Decentralised E2EE Collaboration UI (Minimal)

This is a minimal React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind scaffold implementing a clean UI for a decentralized end-to-end encrypted collaboration platform. It includes Login, Register, and Dashboard pages with mock authentication stored in localStorage.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# install deps
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev
```

Notes
- Replace mock auth and key generation with real crypto and backend logic when ready.
- Tailwind is already configured; styles live in `src/styles.css`.
